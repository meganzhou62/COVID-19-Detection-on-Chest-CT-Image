# COVID 19 Detection on Chest CT Image

This is the project I did in Fall 2021 with four of my teammates from Applied Deep Learning class at Columbia. 

In this project, we utilized deep CNN and transfer learning models including VCG16 and ResNet50 and traditional models (Naive Bayes, SVC and Random Forest) to identify presence of COVID.

The final report document (https://github.com/meganzhou62/COVID-19-Detection-on-Chest-CT-Image/blob/main/Covid%2019%20Detection%20Project%20End%20Report.pdf) contains more details. 

The data for this project was hosted on Google drive.
